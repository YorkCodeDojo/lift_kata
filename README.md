## Brief

Your company has been given the task of writing the lift control system for the Shard in London.  The Shard is 309.6 meters high and has 95 storys.  Although level 72 is the highest habitable floor.
The building has 36 lifts,  some of which are double-deckers.  These lifts can travel up to 6 m/s


## Design Task

As a pair your first task is to write down your requirements for your lift controller.  For example
* On the lowest floor, the user can request a lift to go up.
* Within a lift, the user can request any floor the lift is not currently on.


## Implementation

Working in pairs use you should implement these requirements using Test Driven Development (TDD).  Rules are:

1. Person A writes a failing test.
2. Person B writes just the code required make the test pass.
3. Person B then improves the code by refactoring it.
4. Person A then reviews the code checking for any untested code.  They are allowed to mutate a statement in the code as long as the test still passes.
5. You then swap roles.
